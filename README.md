## <¯ Mission

After 3 years of intense coding and developing some heart rate issues, I've decided to take my health seriously. This repo tracks my daily exercise commitment - because what better way for a developer to stay accountable than with GitHub commits?

## =Ê Current Stats

## > How It Works

1. **Daily Logging**: I update `exercises.json` with my daily activity
2. **Automated Tracking**: GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Updates streak counters
   - Generates activity heatmap
   - Updates README badges
   - Checks for missed days
3. **Visualizations**: Monthly/yearly heatmaps show consistency

## =È Progress Visualization

## =¡ Motivation

> "The body achieves what the mind believes"

Remember: It's not about perfection, it's about consistency. Every day of movement counts!
