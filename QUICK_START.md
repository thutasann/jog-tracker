  "date": "2025-01-21",
  "activity": "Running",
  "duration": "45 minutes",
  "notes": "Morning run, felt energized!"
}
```
3. Commit and push - GitHub Actions will handle the rest!

### Method 2: Using the Template
Copy this template and modify:
```bash
# Today's exercise
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "activity": "Activity Name",
  "duration": "X minutes",

3. **Mix It Up**: Variety prevents boredom
4. **Listen to Your Body**: Rest days are important too
5. **Track Everything**: Bad days happen, but tracking helps you bounce back

## Troubleshooting

**Streak not updating?**
- Check if the date format is correct (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Make sure you pushed to GitHub
- GitHub Actions might take a few minutes

**Want to backfill exercises?**
- You can add multiple entries at once
- Just make sure dates are in the correct format

**Missed a day?**

- Just get back on track tomorrow
